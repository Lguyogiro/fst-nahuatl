# fst-nahuatl
This project is focused on applying Finite-State Transducers to modeling the 
morphology and orthography of a contemporary Nahuatl dialect (Western Sierra Nahuatl, nhi). 
This dialect has some significant internal variation which I will also try to 
capture eventually. For now, the models are built to most closely resemble the 
Nahuatl of Omitl√°n, Tepetzintla.

The primary deliverables of this project are:
1. Morphological analyzer/accepter
2. Spell Checker (uses the morphological accepter from 1)
3. Orthographical Normalization (already implemented in pure Python in a different repo).
